# Who goes or stays?

## Project Overview
I conducted an exploratory data analysis of the customer data of a telecommunication company. I also used a logistic regression for customer segmentation to predict churn. Insights from the analysis can  inform the company on winning strategies for retention of high value customers.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data visualization
- Supervised machine learning
- Model tuning and evaluation

## Objective
To create a machine learning model that can adequately predict customer churn
